## ⚙️ Prerequisites

The following setup has been tested and verified to work:

- **Python** ≥ 3.5
- **PyTorch** ≥ 1.9.0
- **CUDA** ≥ 10.2

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run Main Training
```
python main_training_parallel.py
```

### Implementation Notes
- **Synaptic weight regulation**: Located in `./models/quant_function.py` (lines 22-39, `QCon2d` class)
- **Spike activity regulation**: Implemented in `functions.py` (lines 39-50, `proposedLoss` function)
